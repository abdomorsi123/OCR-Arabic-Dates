# OCR Arabic Dates

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model capable of extracting dates from Egyptian ID cards. The model is trained on the OCR Arabic Dates dataset, which consists of 19,980 images along with corresponding text files containing the date in Arabic script.

## Objective and Methodology

For detailed information about the project's objective, methodology, dataset, steps taken, model deployment, and results, please refer to the [OCR Arabic Birthdates.pdf](OCR%20Arabic%20Birthdates.pdf) document.

## Dataset

### OCR Arabic Dates Dataset
